# EPT2022Project
This final project, assigned in 2022 as part of the EPT (Electronic Publishing Technology) 1-year diploma at Government College of Technology for Printing and Graphic Arts, Allama Iqbal Town Lahore, was a group assignment for me and my friend Furqan Mustafa. We created a website about the 99 names of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with optional use of frameworks like Bootstrap.  

Since I didn’t know JavaScript at the time, Furqan handled the logic, though there wasn’t much JS used except in a few areas. I designed the site and created the cards for each name using Adobe Illustrator, while Furqan worked on the programming and illustrations. We both collaborated on the HTML and CSS.ammad (PBUH).
