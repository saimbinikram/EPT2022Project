# EPT2022Project

This project was developed as part of the **Electronic Publishing Technology (EPT)** diploma at **Government College of Technology for Printing and Graphic Arts**, Allama Iqbal Town, Lahore, in 2022. It was a group assignment undertaken by me and my friend **Furqan Mustafa**.

## Project Overview

We created a website to showcase the **99 Names of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Although I was new to JavaScript at the time, **Furqan** handled the logic with minimal use of JS, while I focused on the design and layout. We both collaborated on the HTML and CSS, and I designed the cards for each name using **Adobe Illustrator**.

### Features:
- Responsive and minimalist design.
- Cards displaying the names of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
- Optional use of frameworks like **Bootstrap**.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Bootstrap** (optional)
